# Notes on WebGL Fundamentals tutorials

The files in this folder contain mostly code examples, notes or libraries taken from the following website:

If you're looking for information on WebGL, and you haven't yet visited that site, I recommend you go there first.

To run this code you can run a python server inside this folder
